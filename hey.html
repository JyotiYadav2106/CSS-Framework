   A CSS framework is a library allowing for easier, more standards and compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. It come with more additional JavaScript based functions, those are mostly design oriented & focused around interactive UI patterns. This differentiates CSS frameworks from other JavaScript frameworks.

      A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.In the world of web design, to give a more straightforward definition, a framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files of standardized code.

      There are basically 2 types to differentiate: backend and frontend , this distinction is drawn whether the framework is for the presentation or the application/ logical layer.It is very important to understand that frameworks are a conceptual notion that is a pre-prepared standard kit from which we have to work. It can be applied to different processes carried out on the web.

      Within CSS frameworks, we can draw a distinction between two types of framework according to their complexity and as per our desire such as we have : simple frameworks and complete frameworks. This is subjective, and doesnâ€™t mean one is better than the others but rather than that they give us different solutions depending on the level of complexity, flexibility.
